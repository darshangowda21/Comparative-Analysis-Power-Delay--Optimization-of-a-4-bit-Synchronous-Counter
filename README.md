# Comparative-Analysis-Power-Delay--Optimization-of-a-4-bit-Synchronous-Counter
Design and analysis of a 4-bit synchronous counter using TSPC-based D flip-flops with AVLS and AVLG techniques. Focused on minimizing power, delay, and leakage using Cadence tools. Includes schematic, layout, simulations, and performance comparisons between conventional and optimized architectures.
